# This repository contains some ADME and health care data projects that I have recently worked on. Each project is in its own folder.
The data folder contains all the data used in the projects. The data is in CSV format. the utils folder contains the script eda_utils.py that contains several data transformation and data visualisation functionalities that I have been using in all of my data science projects.

The projects are:
- Diabetes risk prediction [GitHub Page](https://github.com/abhikmukh/healthcare_data_projetcs).
